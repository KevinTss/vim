# VIM

## Basics

Open a file using vim just enter the name of the file

```
vim myWonderfulFile.md
```

By default, you ar in `normal` mode, it mean that you can only move through the file and make some command.
If you want to update the file, you have to switch to `insetion` mode using the `Ã¬` command.
To coma back to normal mode, just use `Esc`

Command:
- `:set number` will add number for each line of file
- `dd` will delete a entire line
