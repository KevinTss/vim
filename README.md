## Basics

Open a file using vim just enter the name of the file

If you want to update the file, you have to switch to `insetion` mode using the `Ã¬` command.
To coma back to normal mode, just use `Esc`

Command:
- `:set number` will add number for each line of file

- `^r` will redo your last undo
